# Applied Natural Language Processing

## Module Overview

The increasing availability of textual data along with the development of ML and DL make NLP a must-have skill for business and financial analysts. 'Applied Natural Language Processing ― SMM694' provides post-graduate students enrolled in B-school programs with cutting-edge analytical frameworks to manipulate text corpora efficiently and to extract valuable insights out of (apparently) unstructured natural language such as social media posts, product reviews, or corporate communications. Ultimately, the goal of the module is to help students to appreciate how NLP can contribute to the organizational decision-making process.

## Learning Objectives and Assessment

At the end of the module, students should be able:

- to clean, prepare, and transform text corpora;

- to design and operate a variety of NLP pipelines;

- to select the most appropriate NLP framework/tools to address specific business problems;

- to translate NLP outcomes into unique input to the organizational decision-making process.

As per the module specification, students will be assessed on the basis of a group-level, coursework submission — namely, a final course project (details to be available on June 20).
